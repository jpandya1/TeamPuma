        <h1>Our Green Routine</h1>

        <div id="sectionTitle"><u>About</u></div><br>
        <div>
        Proper recycling techniques prove a prevalent and recurring issue in America today.
        Our goal at Our Green Routine is to provide users with a service that assists in:
        <ul>
          <li>understanding what products are recyclable</li>
          <li>knowing in what conditions products are recyclable</li>
          <li>and pointing to facilities that specialize in recycling trash</li>
        </ul>
        Our website will hold a database of recyclable items - accessible by the users.
        Within the database, each recyclable item holds it's own page, which details information about the type of item, materials, health factor, and more.
        In addition to the item database, the website provides a functioning map that shows optimal recylcing centers based on the item chosen.
        The website will feature a carbon footprint tracker that will collect data on items recycled, and show the reduction in the user's carbon footprint based on how much he or she recylced.
        Furthermore, a financial calculator will calculate the overall cost saved based on recylced items.
        A "Recycling Guide" page collects recycling tips, such as how to prepare an item for recycling.
