  <div>
    Proper recycling techniques prove a prevalent and recurring issue in America today.
    Our goal at Our Green Routine is to provide users with a service that assists in:
    <ul>
      <li>understanding what products are recyclable</li>
      <li>knowing in what conditions products are recyclable</li>
      <li>and pointing to facilities that specialize in recycling trash</li>
    </ul>
    Our website will hold a database of recyclable items - accessible by the users.
    Within the database, each recyclable item holds it's own page, which details information about the type of item, materials, health factor, and more.
    In addition to the item database, the website provides a functioning map that shows optimal recylcing centers based on the item chosen.
    The website will feature a carbon footprint tracker that will collect data on items recycled, and show the reduction in the user's carbon footprint based on how much he or she recylced.
    Furthermore, a financial calculator will calculate the overall cost saved based on recylced items.
    A "Recycling Guide" page collects recycling tips, such as how to prepare an item for recycling.

  <div id="subTitle"><u>Data Sources</u></div>
  The primary data source used for this website is the Earth911 Search API.
  This API allows the website to scrape data valuable to the user, such as locations of recycling facilities across the country,
    where to recylce based on the material of the item, and facts about the composition of the item.<br><br>
  <div id="subTitle"><u>Tools Used</u></div>
  This website is built using basic HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
  The locational and item material data is being scraped from the Earth911 Search API.
  Team Puma is utilizing Slack (integrated with Github) and GroupMe as primary communication.
  The website is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.<br><br>
